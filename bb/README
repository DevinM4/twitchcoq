Attack Steps

1. Determine a canonical numbering of all the machines that's easy to enumerate and refer to the machines by. Should be simple, yet remove many isomorphic machines.
(put number here)

2. Exclude all machines that halt with <= 4098 (current ones record)
   Run for 47,176,870 steps
(put number here)

3. Exclude all machines with a repeated state
(put number here)

4. Now it's proving time

How can we put the machines in a proof assistant?
